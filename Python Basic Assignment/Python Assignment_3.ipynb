    "### 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Functions are advantageous because they allow us to write modular, reusable code that can be easily managed and debugged. Instead of repeating code, we can define a function once and call it whenever needed, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency. Functions also help in structuring large programs into smaller, manageable parts, making debugging and maintenance easier."
